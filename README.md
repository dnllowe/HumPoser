# HumPoser

Allows you to compose digital audio songs by simply humming. With this app, you hum into a microphone, and the program translates your audio wavelengths into pitch-corrected notes. These notes are then stored and mapped to instrument samples. This lets you hum to compose music samples for guitar, piano, violin, etc. HumPoser was made in Javascript using Electron, Tone.js, pitch-detect, and Web Audio API.
