# HumPoser

Allows someone to compose digital audio songs by simply humming. With the app, users hum into a microphone, and the program translates their audio wavelengths into pitch-corrected notes. These notes are then stored and mapped to instrument samples. This lets users hum to compose music samples for guitar, piano, violin, etc. I made HumPoser in Javascript using Electron, Tone.js, pitch-detect, and Web Audio API.
